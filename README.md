Hi, I'm Daniel P√∫a (a.k.a. devploit), an infosec enthusiast from C√°diz (Spain), now based in M√°laga. I focus on real-world security challenges and currently play CTFs with [SFPE](https://ctftime.org/team/227086). I was previously part of [ripp3rs](https://ctftime.org/team/50984) and represented Spain in the European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC) as a member of the national team.

I'm currently working at [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/) as **Head of Security**.

Outside of work and CTFs, I maintain [pwny.cc](https://www.pwny.cc)‚Äîa curated repository of offensive payloads and research material for the security community.

In my spare time, I build open source security tools‚Äîalways with the same mindset: _If it parses, it breaks._ üß®
